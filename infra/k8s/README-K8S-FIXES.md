# Kubernetes Service Configuration Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the Kubernetes service configurations for the EV SaaS Platform. These changes ensure proper service connectivity and environment variable configuration across all microservices.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ConfigMap Updates (`01-configmap.yaml`)

- Added direct service URL references for all services
- Added Kafka bootstrap server configuration
- Added Scheduler service host configuration
- Ensured consistent naming conventions across all service references

### 2. Service Deployment Fixes

- Created `service-deployments-fixed.yaml` with the following improvements:
  - Updated all services to use direct service URLs instead of environment variable interpolation
  - Fixed service naming inconsistencies (e.g., smart-charging vs smart-charging-service)
  - Added proper inter-service communication environment variables
  - Set `imagePullPolicy: Never` for local development

### 3. Combined Configuration

- Created `all-services-fixed.yaml` that combines all fixed service configurations:
  - API Gateway (from `api-gateway-fixed.yaml`)
  - Auth Service (from `auth-service-fixed.yaml`)
  - All other services (from `service-deployments-fixed.yaml`)
  - Ingress configuration for external access

### 4. Documentation

- Created `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Added troubleshooting steps and verification procedures

## Key Improvements

1. **Direct Service References**: Services now use direct URLs (e.g., `http://auth-service:8080`) instead of environment variable interpolation, which was causing connectivity issues.

2. **Consistent Environment Variables**: All services now use consistent environment variable names from the ConfigMap.

3. **Service Discovery**: All services are properly configured to register with Eureka service discovery.

4. **Deployment Simplification**: The combined configuration file makes it easier to deploy the entire platform with a single command.

## How to Apply

Refer to the `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` file for detailed deployment instructions. In summary:

```bash
# Apply namespace, ConfigMap, secrets, and infrastructure
kubectl apply -f 00-namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f 01-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f 02-secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f 03-postgres.yaml
kubectl apply -f 04-redis.yaml
kubectl apply -f eureka-server.yaml

# Apply all service deployments with fixes
kubectl apply -f all-services-fixed.yaml
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement monitoring and logging solutions
2. Set up horizontal pod autoscaling
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
4. Add health check endpoints for all services
