# EV SaaS Platform Task Management

This document explains how to use the task management system to track progress on the EV SaaS Platform project tasks defined in the TODO.md file.

## Task Management System

The project tasks have been organized into a task management system that allows you to:

- Track the status of each task
- Mark tasks as complete
- Get approval for completed tasks
- View overall project progress

## Current Tasks

The tasks have been organized according to the project phases defined in TODO.md:

### Phase 1: Core Platform
- Set up mono repo with TurboRepo
- Setup PostgreSQL DB and schema migration (Flyway)
- Implement Auth + EVSE registration
- Integrate OCPP 1.6 backend
- Basic Admin UI (Next.js 14)

### Phase 2: Protocol & Roaming
- OCPI implementation
- Roaming station listing
- Tariff and CDR exchange

### Phase 3: Smart Charging & Grid
- Real-time power balancing logic
- Smart grid interface
- V2G scheduling framework

## How to Use the Task Management System

1. **View Current Tasks**: Use the task manager to see all tasks and their current status
2. **Get Next Task**: Retrieve the next task to work on
3. **Mark Task as Done**: When you complete a task, mark it as done
4. **Get Approval**: Request approval for completed tasks
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor overall project progress

## Task Workflow

1. Get the next task to work on
2. Complete the task implementation
3. Mark the task as done
4. Request approval for the completed task
5. Move on to the next task

## Task IDs

Each task has a unique ID that can be used to reference it in the task management system:

| Task ID | Title |
|---------|-------|
| task-1  | Set up mono repo with TurboRepo |
| task-2  | Setup PostgreSQL DB and schema migration |
| task-3  | Implement Auth + EVSE registration |
| task-4  | Integrate OCPP 1.6 backend |
| task-5  | Basic Admin UI |
| task-6  | OCPI implementation |
| task-7  | Roaming station listing |
| task-8  | Tariff and CDR exchange |
| task-9  | Real-time power balancing logic |
| task-10 | Smart grid interface |
| task-11 | V2G scheduling framework |

## Request ID

The current project is tracked under request ID: `req-1`

This ID is needed when interacting with the task management system.
